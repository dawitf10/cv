      <tr>
        <h1>Binary</h1>
        <li>relating to, using, or expressed in a system of numerical notation that has 2 rather than 10 as a base.</li>
        <h1>Hexadecimal</h1>
        <li>relating to or using a system of numerical notation that has 16 rather than 10 as its base.</li>
        <h1>Bits</h1>
        <li>A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. ... Half a byte (four bits) is called a nibble. In some systems, the term octet is used for an eight-bit unit instead of byte.</li>
        <h1>Nibble</h1>
        <li>a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit.</li>
        <h1>Kilo</h1>
        <li>Kilo is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by one thousand (103). It is used in the International System of Units where it has the unit symbol k, in lower case</li>
        <h1>Mega</h1>
        <li> is a unit prefix in metric systems of units denoting a factor of one million (106 or 1000000). It has the unit symbol M. It was confirmed for use in the International System of Units</li>
        <h1>Giga</h1>
        <li>giga (1) Billion (10 to the 9th power). Abbreviated "G," it is a prefix for capacities and speeds (gigabits, gigabytes, gigahertz, etc.). ... Both "giga" and "mega" are used in this manner, although giga means billion and mega means million.</li>
        <h1>Tera</h1>
        <li>Tera may refer to any of the following: 1. Abbreviated as T, tera is a prefix used with the metric system that stands for 1,000,000,000,000 (trillion). A unit with the prefix tera is 10 to the 12th power, or one trillion. A good example of where this prefix is used with computers is with a TB (terabyte)</li>
        <h1>Function</h1>
        <li>In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</li>
        <h1>Variable</h1>
        <li>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.</li>
        <h1>String</h1>
        <li>A string is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers. ... Typically, programmers must enclose strings in quotation marks for the data to recognized as a string and not a number or variable name.</li>
        <h1>git</h1>
        <li> is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.</li>

        <h1>Desktop</h1>
        <li>the working surface of a desk.</li>
        <h1>Menu Bar</h1>
        <li>A menu bar is a graphical control element which contains drop-down menus. The menu bar's purpose is to supply a common housing for window- or application-specific menus which provide access to such functions as opening files, interacting with an application, or displaying help documentation or manuals.</li>
        <h1>Dock</h1>
        <li>Alternatively referred to as a universal port replicator, a docking station is a hardware device that allows portable computers to connect with other devices with little or no effort. Docking stations enable users with a laptop computer to convert it into a desktop computer when at the office or at home.</li>
        <h1>Launchpad</h1>
        <li>Definition of: Launchpad. Launchpad. Apple's optional iPhone/iPad-like interface for the Mac. Introduced with Lion Version 10.7 in 2011, it provides an icon grid for launching Mac applications similar to Apple's mobile devices.</li>
        <h1>Window</h1>
        <li>A window is a separate viewing area on a computer display screen in a system that allows multiple viewing areas as part of a graphical user interface ( GUI ). Windows are managed by a windows manager as part of a windowing system . A window can usually be resized by the user.</li>
        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <li>An application, or application program, is a software program that runs on your computer. Web browsers, e-mail programs, word processors, games, and utilities are all applications. The word "application" is used because each program has a specific application for the user.</li>
        <h1>Web Browser</h1>
        <li>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. ... The most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge.</li>
        <h1>Terminal</h1>
        <li>Early computer programs were managed through the use of a command line interface, a method of control that is still available on modern computers. On a Mac computer, the command line interface comes in the form of the Terminal application. On a Windows 7 computer, the Terminal equivalent is the Command Prompt program</li>
        <h1>Bash</h1>
        <li>Bash, though typically not capitalized, is an acronym for "Bourne-Again Shell" and is named after Stephen Bourne, the creator of the Unix shell "sh." It is a command language interpreter derived from sh that can execute commands entered at a command prompt and process text file input.</li>
        <h1>Finder</h1>
        <li>The Finder is the desktop interface of Macintosh computers. It allows users to move, copy, delete, and open files, navigate through folders, and move windows around the desktop. ... While the Finder is a core component of the Mac OS, it is technically an application.</li>
        <h1>Files </h1>
        <li></li>
        <h1>Folders</h1>
        <li>When talking about file systems, a folder (also called directory, or catalog) is a way to organize computer files. A folder is a storage space where many files can be placed into groups and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders.</li>
        <h1>File System</h1>
        <li>In a computer, a file system -- sometimes written filesystem -- is the way in which files are named and where they are placed logically for storage and retrieval.</li>
        <h1>Compressed Files</h1>
        <li>File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet. It enables the creation of a version of one or more files with the same data at a size substantially smaller than the original file.</li>
        <h1>Bytes</h1>
        <li>a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit</li>
        <h1>Relative Paths</h1>
        <li>A path can either be relative or absolute. A relative path defines a location that is relative to the current directory or folder. ... Absolute paths are defined from the root directory of the file system. This means no matter what folder is currently open, the absolute path to any given file is the same.</li>
        <h1>Absolute Paths</h1>
        <li>An absolute path refers to the complete details needed to locate a file or folder, starting from the root element and ending with the other subdirectories. Absolute paths are used in websites and operating systems for locating files and folders. An absolute path is also known as an absolute pathname or full path.</li>
